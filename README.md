### To do.

- \*\*\* When in trend year I need the rows to start at the beginning of the trend year.
- \*\*\* In slice make sure nulls are defaulting to NO VALUE
- On the front end when switching back from YTD trend to another trend then the max selections is not being enforced until the next click
- \*\*\* Make the columns work for inven and production.
- Make production have a filter for type and make work with YTD trend
- Sort is not defaulting on a slice
- Make YoY work in sales and production
- Make a purchasing report.
