### To do.

- \*\*\* When in trend year I need the rows to start at the beginning of the trend year.
- \*\*\* In slice make sure nulls are defaulting to NO VALUE
- On the front end when switching back from YTD trend to another trend then the max selections is not being enforced until the next click
- \*\*\* Make the columns work for inven and production.
- Make production have a filter for type and make work with YTD trend
- Sort is not defaulting on a slice
- Make YoY work in sales and production
- Make a purchasing report.
- On front end when in slice, if opening the main dropdown menu the filter row is in front of the menu.
- Would like to add a total row when slice is being filtered.
- There is no row slice yet for production reports
- In the production report the purchase receipts does not have the rows for it.

- FIRST: production report does not work with years trend uyet because I did not update the postgres queries

- Dont have sales projections table in the getRowLabels for base report sales
