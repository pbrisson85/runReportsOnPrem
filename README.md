### To do.

- Get rows in base and slice should include the sales projections tables as well in addition to the existing sales and sales orders in the query
- Need to be able to identify if there are any sales specific filters to know whether to exclude inventory items from rows in a slice (see l1_getRowLabels in slice: getRowLabels for the helper I created but is inadequate because needs a config to maintain this concept.)
